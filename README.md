# ENAUTO_scripts
Here are the many study scripts I accumulated while studying for the Cisco ENAUTO 300-435.

Don't mind the mess!

I'll be working on adding comments and general cleaning up of the various code examples.

Each section and sub-section corresponds to the topics listed here in the exam blueprint:

I also have notes available; for those interested you can reach me here:

Enjoy!
